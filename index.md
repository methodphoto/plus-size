Compiled by Charlotte Earney. Please get in touch via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/charlotteearney) if you know of any missing brands that ship to the UK or of any shipping/sizing info that would be useful for shoppers. 

I have not tried all of these brands, this is not advertising nor is this an endorsement of any of these brands, but just a useful resource. My definition of plus size in this context is any brand that goes above a UK size 20/XL.

A * indicates a brand that does international shipping - if you are not UK based they are likely to also ship to you so itâ€™s worth checking!
